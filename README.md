You could select which one to autohide in options page.

## Why build this?

There are a bunch of existing extensions for Gmail UI tweaks, but most are just too heavy to me. I don't want to transform the Gmail to another tool, I am fine with Gmail in general, I ONLY want some extra space on the screen.
